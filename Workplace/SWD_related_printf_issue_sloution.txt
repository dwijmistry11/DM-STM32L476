If you are facing issues of printf printing on console by using SWD ITM, Here is the solution.

Steps:
1) open goole.com
2) search for your microcontroller datasheet
    Eg. If you are using STM32L476RG Nucleo board.
    Search for controller "STM32L476RG datasheet".
3) open STM32L476RG datasheet.
4) Press "CTRL+F" (Find option in PDF document).
5) Now write "Startup clock" in search box and hit enter.
6) look for "The MSI is used as system clock source after startup from Reset configured at ________Mhz."   <----Here, this blank line contain frequency value.
7) Now, when you are configuring in "Debug Configuration" window -> "Debugger" tab -> "Serial Wire Viewer(SWV)" section -> "core clock = ____________ MHz" <---- write the frequency we got from step 6 to here.
8) click debug.

Thank you.
